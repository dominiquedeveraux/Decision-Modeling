# Decision-Modeling
Data for recruiting agencies to help them make decisions on recruiting top performers.

1.Task
As part of this task, your team will embark on a journey to gather relevant data sources, ensuring their accuracy, completeness, and relevance to the investigation at hand. 
Begin by identifying potential data sources, including logs, user accounts, system activities, and any other pertinent information related to the reported odd happenings on the server. 
Once gathered, meticulously cleanse the data to remove any inconsistencies, errors, or irrelevant information that may skew analysis results. 
Utilize tools such as Python, Excel, or PowerBI/Tableau for data cleansing and transformation, ensuring data integrity and consistency throughout the process. 
Finally, delve into data analysis, exploring patterns, anomalies, and trends to uncover insights into the malicious activity and identify potential bad actors within the system. 

2.Task
In this task, you and your team will utilize the data previously collected, cleansed, and analyzed to create predictive models for your client. You and your team can explore different techniques such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks to address various aspects of your client's needs.
Perform Linear Regression Analysis:
Apply linear regression techniques to forecast future trends based on historical data.
Develop models to predict performance outcomes and analytics. 
Evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the regression models.
Utilize Decision Trees:
Construct decision trees to aid in the recruitment decision-making process.
Assess factors like behavioral patterns, project involvement, and performance metrics to determine candidate suitability.
Validate the decision trees through testing and validation procedures.
Implement Classification Models and Neural Networks:
Build classification models and neural networks for deep analysis of the data.
Identify patterns within the performances and data set
Fine-tune the models to improve accuracy and reduce false positives/negatives.

3.Task
Now that you have completed the process of cleansing, analyzing data, and building predictive models, it's time to determine the champion model that will guide the company's recruitment decisions effectively.

Review Model Outcomes: Evaluate the performance of each model, considering metrics such as precision, accuracy, recall, and overall effectiveness in predicting recruitment outcomes.
Assess Model Refinement: Determine if any further refinement is necessary to enhance the precision and accuracy of the models. Consider tweaking parameters or exploring additional modeling techniques to improve performance.
Consider Alternative Models: Reflect on whether there are any alternative models that could potentially offer better outcomes or complement the existing models. Evaluate their feasibility and potential impact on decision-making processes.
Ask Critical Questions: Challenge the selected model by asking questions like, "Is this truly the best option available?" and "If so, how can we further optimize it to maximize its effectiveness?"
Select the Champion Model: Based on your evaluation and analysis, choose the model that demonstrates the highest level of predictive accuracy, reliability, and suitability for guiding recruitment decisions.
